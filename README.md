# MetaPlus
MetaPlus is a musicological experiment. The purpose is to develop an app for the generation of Plus-Minus (Karlheinz Stockhausen) versions.

The purpose is an app that can generate a version of Plus-Minus. The version is either a score that can be performed by any number of musicians, or a MIDI file that can be played through a MIDI player.

Plus-Minus is a musical composition, dated 1963, by the German composer Karlheinz Stockhausen (http://www.karlheinzstockhausen.org). It is a unique piece that needs an interpretation before it can be played. The score consists of a set of pages with a unique set of symbols, a set of pages with notes, and a set of 33 instructions how to make a version. The piece has hardly been performed because it requires quite some work before it can be played.

The MetaPlus project is meant to enable anyone to make his/her own version, based on a set of questions that have to be answered.
